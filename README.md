# Persona IM

A real-world implementation of the in-game Instant Messaging app in Persona 5. Built for Android with Jetpack Compose and Stream Chat SDK.

Persona 5 has one of the most stylish user interfaces, including its in-game messaging app (IM). This repository attempts to answer what it might look like if it were a real app, and how it could be built for Android with Jetpack Compose and the latest Android tools.
